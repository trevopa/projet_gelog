# Software engineering project

This is the main repository for the two projects in python (ensai-webscrapping) and java (gelog).

You can explore the two projects which both have their readme. The java one implements the desigin pattern strategy.

Here we have the compare_extractors.sh script.

To launch it: 
```
source compare_extractors.sh
```

The java compilation fails when compiling the Extractor class because it can't import external packages.

Otherwise the script does what it is told to do.
